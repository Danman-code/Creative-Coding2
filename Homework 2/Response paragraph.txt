I made ChatGPT draw a car, and it actually came out relatively similar to mine. Since it can only use simple shapes, we both made the body of the car out of squares and the wheels out of circles. However, ChatGPT made the body and windows a little more believable than I did, and it made it in a few seconds, as opposed to mine taking much more time. ChatGPT also included a sky which I did not. At first glance, the AI may seem more artistic than me, but I assure you that is only a discrepancy between our coding skills. However, I think the AI probably did a better job than I did, but I still think AI should not be used for serious artistic purposes, as it destroys the humane aspects of art.
