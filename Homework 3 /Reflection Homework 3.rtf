\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this assignment, the AI (I used Grok) was able to make a satisfactory art piece, with clear, concise lines of code in just a few seconds. It followed every rule of the assignment like I told it to, and it was easy to understand what it was doing. As for how AI writes the code, it samples through tons of existing code on the internet, and learns what is likely needed to be written to complete the task. Technically, it does have limitations if you were to ask it to code something that is extremely complex and has never been coded before, but I am not at that point. For simple coding, I think AI is extremely useful. It can do simple assignments like this in mere seconds without nearly any issues. }
