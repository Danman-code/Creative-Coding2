\f0\fs24 \cf0 I used Grok to generate my image, because I gravitate to it over chatGPT because I find it gives me more direct answers. As for the image, it was impressively photorealistic and honestly nearly indistinguishable from the real photos. I wasn\'92t expecting such an impressive result. This was helpful because now I know if I need a specific image I might not be able to find, generating it with AI may not be a bad idea. }
